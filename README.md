FunTrip
=======

The end goal of this project is to allow people to forward their trip emails (e.g. flight
and hotel reservation emails) to FunTrip email and it will create their trip in the TripIt system.

Currently TripIt provides an email (plans@tripit.com) but it doesn't understand the
emails from my travel agency.

Running
-------

1. Copy sample.env to .env and configure it
2. bundle
3. foreman start
